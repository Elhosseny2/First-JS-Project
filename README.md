# First-JS-Project

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game I created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

It helped me practice fundamental JavaScript concepts and logic-building skills.

**Features**

A fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game played against the computer.

The computer's moves are randomized for fairness.

Keeps track of the player's and computer's scores.

No need to open the console, it is a user-friendly, interactive and simple web game.


This project was a great way to apply JavaScript concepts in a fun and interactive way. It also strengthened my problem-solving skills as I worked through game mechanics.
